Orders over the allowed import limit would also be subject to import taxes.  These fees are not included in my price or the shipping cost, they are fees assessed by your customs office and they are collected on your end to be remitted to your government.\r\nBecause of these high fees, I have had numerous complaints and packages refused from the UK.  I have no control over these fees, nor can I remit the fees on behalf of the customer.  I have therefore made the decision to discontinue shipping to the UK.  If you are in the UK and you would like to order anyway, please contact me and I will set up a custom listing for you with the understanding that returns for non-payment of import fees will not be refunded.",

Just let us know when you place your order.  Re-sizing usually changes the price, so please convo me for a quote FIRST and I will create a custom order for you.\r\n\r\nAll decals come with easy to read instructions, but I do find that this video on You-Tube is also very helpful to watch before hanging your decal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LlNVr1trII&feature=related",

                "policy_additional": "Q: CAN I GET THIS DESIGN MADE IN ANOTHER COLOR?\nA: For cut vinyl decals, there are more than 80 designer colors in a beautiful matte paint like finish to choose from.  Four metallic shimmer colors are also available.  \n\nFor Printed Fabric Decals we cannot change the colors unless noted in the listing.  If a color change is available the option will appear in a drop-down menu choice on the listing.\n\n    Colors may not show true to life on different monitors and view devices.  Contact us for a free swatch before ordering if you need to match a color exactly.\n\nQ: DOES THE PAINT TYPE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\nA: Yes!  There are some new fancy schmacy paints out on the market that claim they are dirt resistant or stain resistantâ¦fantastic if you have little sticky fingers living with you, but not so much for wall decalsâ¦these paints contain silicone and nothing will stick to it.  If you have this kind of paint, consider applying your decal to a painted board or canvas, creating a great wall hanging insteadâ¦added bonus, you can move it.\n\nSome VOC free paints have also been known to cause adhesive failure in wall decals, but this seems to be hit and miss.  If you are unsure of your type of paint, contact us for a free test decal to try before you buy.  We cannot give refunds due to incompatible paint or surface issues.\n\nQ: ARE WALL DECALS REMOVABLE?\nA:  Yes, but because the wall decals are super thin to get that paint like effect, you will not be able to reapply them to another wall. (with the exception of printed fabric decals which are re-usable)\n\nQ: WILL WALL DECALS DAMAGE MY PAINT?\nA: The adhesive used for these decals is specially formulated to be removed from paint without damage or leaving a residue.  However, we cannot anticipate every situation.  For best results, do not apply on old peeling paint, lead paint or any area where there may be moisture, mold or damage under the paint.  Paint must be allowed to fully dry and cure for at least 3 weeks before applying a decal.  Paint takes several weeks to fully hardenâ¦during this curing time, invisible gasses and moisture are released from the paint.  If decals are applied too soon after new painting, this moisture will become trapped behind the decal.  The decal adhesive could fail and also possibly damage to the paint causing it to peel or become discolored.\n\nQ: ARE WALL DECALS EASY TO APPLY?\nA: Each wall decal comes with easy to follow instructions and a link to an application video.  Larger more detailed design will naturally take longer and you may need a helper.  Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions about application.\n\nQ: ARE WALL DECALS ONLY FOR WALLS?\nA: No way!  Why limit yourselfâ¦as long as you have a surface that is smooth, flat and clean, you will be able to apply your wall sticker. Furniture, mirrors, doors, glass and woodâ¦the possibilities are only limited by your imagination.\n\nQ: WILL DECALS STICK TO TEXTURED WALLS?\nA: If you have a light texture, the decals may work with a little extra patience when applying. If you havenât use a wall decal before and you are unsure about your surface, contact us for a free test decal to try before you buy.\n\nQ:  WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY ORDER?\nWe make all of my decals to order, so there is generally a 3-5 business day turn around time for this.  Shipping is on Tuesday - Thursday.\nI ship via USPS First Class Mail within the US, US Territories and Military addresses. \nI ship via USPS First Class International for all other orders. (please note that international customers may incur an import fee or tax on their end.)\n\nShipping upgrades for faster shipping methods are available at checkout.  Please note that a shipping upgrade does NOT include expedited production.  If you need something faster, contact me. I am happy to accommodate you if I can...during the busier times of the year, an expedited production fee of $25 will be added to rush orders.\n\nQ:  WHAT ARE YOUR BUSINESS HOURS?\nMonday - Thursday 9am-3pm MST\n\nI typically answer emails first thing in the mornings and then through out the day as time allows between fulfilling orders..  All email questions sent from Thursday after 3pm through the weekend will be answered on Monday morning....so please don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t hear back from me right away.\n\nDuring the Holiday Rush season, we do often work on orders during the weekends to make sure all orders meet our 3-5 business day turn around time frame.\n\nQ: DO YOU HAVE ANY PROMOTIONS OR DISCOUNTS RIGHT NOW?\nI very rarely do sales or offer coupon codes to the public, but you can sign up for our Exclusive VIP list to receive information about new products and VIP only sales and discounts.  \n\nSign up here with this link and you will receive a coupon code for 20% off your entire order that you can use today.\n\nhttp://eepurl.com/cUq3Zz",

            "description": "Vintage table cover or wall hanging with Suf Stitching\n\nAn exquisite vintage table cover or wall hanging intricately hand embroidered using &#39;Suf&#39; stitch in vibrant multicoloured silk on off white cotton. &#39;Suf&#39; work is a very skillfully executed style of embroidery,  where the threads on the backing are painstakingly counted and used to create very precise geometric patterns. In this piece the geometric pattern has been used to create a stylised representation of two double rows of ladies dancing. \n\nThis is an exceptionally fine example in superb condition for its age. The stitching is in perfect condition with just a few very small stains that are hard to spot,  and do not detract from the overall visual impact of this rare piece. \n\nMade by people of the Kathi (Carpenter) community in Diplo village, Pakistan, c1950.\n\n215cm x 125cm (84.6 inches x 49.2 inches)\n\nVTAB1",

The background is a  light brown color with small stars floating behind the words âDonât Panic!â A really cool piece to have regardless of you are familiar with the Hitchhikerâs Guide. The diameter is 5 inches across.\n\n*This item was hand made and finished with teak oil for protection.\n\n* All plaques are equipped with hardware for hanging already installed.\n\n*Any natural defects in the wood can cause undesired effects, which I try to use to my advantage.",

            "description": "Vintage Dolphin Japan Fine China 9 Piece Tea/Dessert Set, Including a Pedestal Base Cake Plate in the Olympus Pattern. \n\nThis is a gorgeous set! It is hard to find so many pieces all together. It came from an estate sale and is in very good vintage condition. The set includes 4 dessert plates/saucers, 4 tea cups and 1 cake plate. The pattern is well in-tact, with slight fade to the green band around the edge of the cake plate and snack plates in various spots. The pattern consists of orange/purple poppies, orange and yellow flowers and green leaves/stems on a bright white background. The only blemishes that I can find are shown in the last two pictures. There is a small black smudge on the bottom of one snack plate and a tiny brown spot inside one tea cup. There is also one large scratch on the cake plate, which I almost did not notice (you can barely see it).\n\nAll 9 pieces have the same maker&#39;s mark on the bottom that reads Dolphin Fine China Japan Olympus. \nThe cake plate measures approximately 10&quot; in diameter x 4 1/4&quot; tall. \nThe snack plates measure approximately 8 1/4&quot; in diameter.\nThe tea cups measure approximately 4 1/4&quot; including handle x 3 1/2&quot; x 3&quot; tall. \n\nTo view more items like this one click here: www.etsy.com/shop/DidisVintageKitchen\n\nFollow me on:\nFacebook www.facebook.com/didisvintagekitchen\nInstagram www.instagram.com/danielle_didis_vintage_kitchen/\n\nNotes from the Seller:\nPlease keep in mind that vintage items may have small imperfections from age or flaws from production.

Once your item is marked shipped, it should take 3-5 days to arrive in the US (longer when holidays are involved).  **Please verify your address prior to placing your order.**\n\nInternational orders may take 6-10 days (according to the US Postal Service).  VAT Import or Customs fees may be levied by the country receiving the package; these fees are the responsibility of the customer to research and pay.\n\nComes from a pet-free, smoke-free home.\n\nThere is no hanging loop on this pot holder.\n\nI am not a professional seamstress.

Proper care simply entails washing in warm, soapy water following use and drying with a towel, then a few times each year applying a light coat of food grade mineral oil to waterproof the surface. A quality hardwood cutting board will not dull your knives like the typical dollar store plastic ones and the extremely dense cell structure found in real hardwoods will not allow germs to penetrate below the surface. There are no harsh chemicals in our boards, only hardwoods, wood glue, food grade mineral oil and beeswax, period. If I wouldn&#39;t use an item in my personal kitchen to prepare a meal for family and friends, then I&#39;d never sell it to you for use in yours! Unless otherwise specified our boards are mounted on non-skid rubber feet to ensure a stable work surface.",

You can either send us a message and we can make you a listing, or you can purchase something in the store and add instructions at checkout.  We can do custom paper shape die-cuts, custom cufflinks, custom laser cut things, and custom flowers.\n\nWe can make paper flowers from almost anything! All bouquets are totally customizable. \nPaper die-cuts can be cut in almost any shape and color. Just ask!\n\nCustom laser items are not eligible for returns or refunds! Please be very sure it is what you want before you order. We can send you a sample picture before you order, if you want a mock-up done.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\n-We can make paper flowers in any size, from teeny to huge!  \n\n-Paper die-cut shapes can be done from small (about 1&quot;) to huge (usually around 10.5&quot;).  Some shapes have too much &quot;detail&quot; to be done really small.  Almost anything can be done huge!\n\n-Wood guest book puzzles can be done in any size. Price will increase with size of puzzle, as we have to use more wood to make it.\n\n-Pretty much everything in our store can be changed to a different size. Please message us with questions!\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\n-Most of our jewelry is silver plated.  Silver plate needs to be polished just like regular silver. It&#39;s actually easier to clean than sterling silver.\n\n-If you buy a lace pendant or memory locket from me, please DO NOT submerge it in water. Waterproof memory lockets available upon request. \n\n-Paper flowers do best if kept out of direct sunlight.  They will fade if you leave them sitting in the sun.\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\n-All items are packaged really well for shipping!  Especially the paper stuff. \n\n-We package all jewelry (cufflinks, earrings, necklaces, etc) in a gift box.\n\n-If you want a note included with your order, please leave me a note at checkout with what you want it to say. :)\n\nWHOLESALE AVAILABILITY\n-We will give discounts for bulk orders.
