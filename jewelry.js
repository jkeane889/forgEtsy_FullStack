          "description": "Own a piece of fashion history! This dress clip was worn at the collar or waist of a dress. It features large faux pearls with gold-tone leaves intertwined. The backside is gold-tone filigree with a hinged, toothed clasp which is in working condition. There is some wear to the piece overall due to its age. The faux pearls are also slightly worn, especially where they rub against each other or the metal, and one pearl on the side seems to be a bit loose. The clip is about 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to zoom in to get a closer look!\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to ask any questions or request additional pictures.\r\n\r\nI will ship internationally and combine shipping on multiple items purchased-just ask!\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to read my shop&#39;s policies on shipping and returns prior to purchasing.\r\n\r\nFor more unique vintage items, visit my Etsy shop at www.etsy.com/shop/TheYOLOSubmarine\r\nMore items are always being added!",

Shipping is non-refundable. If an item is agreed to be returned, tracking must be included. The item must be in the same condition as when it was sent out. Buyers pay shipping on returns. We will not refund for size or color issues. If you need more detailed pictures other than what are available on our site, we would be happy to send them to you personally.\n\nPlease make sure that you are satisfied with our return policies before making a purchase.\n\nADDITIONAL SHOP POLICIES:\nEach one of our pieces is a handmade item, due to that nature there will of course be some slight variations in each piece. We are fastidious and do our best to maintain consistency in a piece. We make a very serious effort to create unique, quality jewelry. Beads may slightly vary in shapes and sizes. Since many of our beads are natural stone, rock and crystal, it is common for them to have inclusions, variations and slight discolorations. We strive to chose elements that are as complimentary to each other as possible. These variations are really what make each piece unique. Please note that with beaded earrings, the longer and wider the bead work, there may be some folding and gapping. Even weather plays a factor in this.\n\nADDITIONAL ITEM INFORMATION:\nWe aim to capture each piece as true to life as possible in our pictures. If you should need any clarification on an item, please inquire. We would be happy to send you additional pictures, or answer any questions you may have.\n\nADDITIONAL SHIPPING INFORMATION:\nOnce an item is shipped, if it is lost or stolen, it is the customers responsibility to file a claim with the post office. In the event that there are USPS shipping delays, please remember that this is entirely out of our control. If we could magically beam our lovelies to you we would, but we are also at the mercy of the USPS shipping services. Remember, we have put a lot of care into each of our pieces and are thrilled that you have deemed it worthy to adorn yourself with! We have to utmost confidence in the USPS delivery system but in the event that something does go awry on their end, please remember this was out of our hands. Please verify your address before purchase completion.\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nBeaded jewelry requires easy care, and following a few tips should keep your lovelies in tip top shape for years to come. Be gentle! Remember the beads are made of glass and are delicate. Please try not to drop them. We recommend that our beaded earrings be stored flat if possible. Hanging is acceptable as well, but you may see some gapping as the thread is made of Nylon and is flexible. With a GENTLE almost absent stroke of the earrings, this gap can be rectified. Do not pull or tug, this could cause the thread to break. Extreme humidity can also cause changes in the thread. We recommend avoiding places that have high levels of steam while wearing them. Our beaded necklaces often use beading wire, try not to bend or kink the wire.",

            "description": "Custom Coordinate Bracelet - Personalized Latitude Longitude Jewelry\n\nOne of my most popular bracelets, these make the perfect gifts for bridesmaids, sorority sisters and for ever other special person in your life!\n\nThe hand stamped piece is approximately 1 3/4&quot; long and 1/4&quot; tall.  All edges and corners are rounded over and smooth. The natural leather bracelet is completely adjustable and will fit up to a 7.5&quot; wrist. Multiple colors of leather are available as well.  Please convo for details. \n\nBack side stamping is limited to a 15 characters or less.\n\n~\n\n❋ How to find your coordinates: The easiest way, I&#39;ve found, is to use Google Maps. Here are the instructions: https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?hl=en. \n\nIf you&#39;d rather I pull the address/location, please include it in the personalization box.\n\n~\n\n❋ A quick note about my process\n\nThis piece is made with pure aluminum. Aluminum pieces, while lighter in weight, are as brilliant as sterling silver and offer a far less chance of an allergic reaction compared to sterling or other metals. The stamped piece will not tarnish, rust, discolor, etc., nor will it leave marks on your skin.\n\nEach letter individually hand stamped by me. The process of hand stamping involves using a hammer and steel stamps to impress letters, numbers and symbols onto metal. While I try to be consistent, there may be variations in spacing, alignment and depth of letters. Simply, this adds the charm to the art hand stamping. :) I am definitely my own worst critic, though, and will never let something go out that I wouldn&#39;t wear myself.\n\n\nThank you so much for shopping Pink Lemon!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PinkLemonDesignStudios\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/pinklemondesignstudios",

Each listing will have instructions as to how to place your custom order, but you&#39;re always welcome to send me a convo with questions. :)\n\nPlease know that images/photographs of completed works may be used within listings as examples of work done. Should you wish your piece not be used in this manner, please let me know. Thank you!\n\nWHAT IS HAND STAMPING?\nThe process of hand stamping involves using a hammer and steel stamps to impress letters, numbers and symbols onto metal. While I try to be consistent, there may be variations in spacing, alignment and depth of letters. Simply, this adds the charm to the art hand stamping. I am definitely my own worst critic, though, and will never let something go out that I&#39;m not 100% happy with.\n\nWHAT METALS DO YOU USE?\nMy three favorite metals are aluminum, red brass (nu gold) and copper.  I am always willing to upgrade your piece to Sterling or Argentium Silver and/or Gold Fill.  Please convo prior to ordering for pricing.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TARNISH AND WILL COPPER TURN MY SKIN GREEN?\nWhile I take care in protecting your piece to delay tarnish, red brass and copper, as it is in their nature, will eventually tarnish. Your order will arrive with a polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish tab. Care instructions are also included.\n\nHow quickly will red brass and/or copper tarnish?\nIt&#39;s hard to say how quickly a piece will tarnish because it depends on so many factors. Those factors can include a person&#39;s skin chemistry, lotions and perfumes as well as environmental conditions.\n\nWill copper turn my skin green?\nCopper will not stain skin, but it can turn skin green for a brief period of time. It a natural reaction to an individual&#39;s body chemistry and is dependent on the person.\n\nHOW DO I CLEAN MY JEWELRY?\nYour Pink Lemon Design hand stamped jewelry should only be cleaned with a polishing pad or cloth. Using a jewelry cleaning solution may remove the oxidation on the letters. When cleaning, be sure the item is dry, free from dust and other abrasives then very gently rub the surface to be cleaned in a circular motion.\n\nCan I restore the shine to polished pieces?\nDefinitely! Each order is shipped with a polishing cloth which will contains special cleansing agents & non-scratching micro-abrasives. The cloth will turn black with use but is still good for many cleanings.\n\nSAFETY NOTES\nPlease, always use caution when allowing a child to wear jewelry. Do not allow a child to wear any piece unsupervised and/or while sleeping. All small parts are considered choking hazards for children under the age of 6. Do not allow a child to place any part of the jewelry piece in their mouth.\n\nWith wrapped bracelets, be sure that the bracelet is not tied too tightly. It should be slightly snug & you should be able to place a finger under the wrap with ease. Necklaces must always be worn under adult supervision.\n\nPink Lemon Design & its owners are not responsible for any incidents that may occur. By purchasing you are acknowledging that you are aware of the above disclaimer & will not hold Pink Lemon Design and/or its owners responsible.\n\nPROCESSING TIMES AND PACKAGING\nMy current processing time (the time it takes me to hand craft your purchase) is currently 3 to 5 business days before shipping.\n\nAll items are carefully packed in zippered bags. Pieces that may tarnish, such as copper and nu gold/red brass are sent with anti-tarnish tabs. All items are send with a polishing pad or cloth & care instructions.\n\nYour purchase will be sent in a kraft box with a cotton insert which is tied with ribbon or twine and shipped in a padded bubble mailer. When ordering multiples, please know that while I would love to send each individual piece in it&#39;s own box, to save on shipping & handling costs for you, items may be combined into one box. Should you wish for each piece to ship in its own box, please message.\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION, INTERNATIONAL TAX/CUSTOM FEES & DELIVERY ESTIMATES\nA 6% sales tax will be applied to all orders shipped or billed to a Florida address.\n\nUS Shipping: Unless otherwise selected, all purchases are shipped via USPS First Class Mail. Delivery time is generally 2-7 business days. Delivery confirmation and a tracking number are provided.\n\nFor Canadian & other international orders: If applicable, your purchase may require you to pay duty and/or taxes. Please review your country&#39;s import fees as I can not be held responsible for those costs nor do I have the ability to collect this tax. \nDepending on location, international delivery can take anywhere from 6 days to 3+ weeks.\n\nShipping costs are non-refundable after an item has shipped.\n\nREFUNDS, EXCHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS\nPlease know that all sales are final and refunds are not available on any personalized items. However, I absolutely want you to love your jewelry so if you&#39;re not 100% satisfied, please message, and I&#39;ll do everything I can to make sure you&#39;re happy!\n\nAny errors made on my part with stamping will immediately be corrected.\n\nCancellations need to be placed within 2 days of purchase.  I am unable to cancel an order once it is in production and/or in the process of being shipped.  \n\nShipping costs are non-refundable.",

            "description": "DS1066\n\n⍟ This device is hand made with pure love. \n⍟ These talismans are functional art // no two are alike!\n⍟ Listing is specifically for the talisman pictured. \n⍟ Comes with adjustable black cotton string. Can be worn short or long.\n\nThese devices are built as harmonization tools. These cannot - in any way - be programmed for low vibrational thought forms. It's existence can only assist the collective rise to new heights. ‼️ This is important to consider when buying energy tools from ANYONE. Be sure you CONNECT to the creator to feel if they AUTHENTICALLY resonate with you. Let your intuition guide you. I INVITE you to ask questions and connect with me before purchasing. 💗\n\n✶ Special note about my work: I am simply a facilitator of crystals. Everything is made fluidly, similar to channeling art.  \nAll crystal know who they will be going home to. I intuit my work as the crystals communicate to you before you even receive your device. Each device will resonate a frequency to you and if you feel called to it, that is not by mistake. \n✶ Crystal technology // Orgone Pyramids designed with re-harmonizing frequencies, intentions and crystals to bring spiritual awareness, JOY, creativity and protection in your field. \n✶ All devices can be programmed (but function regardless of your belief system) - I suggest programming them to your specific callings (love, joy, prosperity, protection etc) as they work 10 fold with intention. You create your own reality, so take it upon yourself to manifest all that you are called to with focus, intention, feeling and action. \n✶ Each device is functional art sculptures. No two are alike!  If you are called towards crystal technology and orgone devices, I recommend doing your own research. Try googling Wilhelm Reich, Orgone Generators, Orgone Energy and Crystal Consciousness. I find that self-education on metaphysical / quantum technology is the best way to re-member the power within and without. \n✶ Each piece is created with quality crystals that were cleansed with tensor rings, re-harmonized with crystal bowls/tuning forks, smudged with Palo Santo, re-programmed under a vogel crystal light rack.\n✶ Made with love and cosmic light\n\n✶ healing crystals are spiritual allies to healing and are not meant as health care information or prescriptions ✶\n\nLICENSEE is a licensed distributor of Orgone Generator® and Orgonite® which are trademarks owned by Karl Hans Welz, the inventor of these devices and the brand Orgonite®, which is famous as one of the most high quality experimental energy substances available",

Please message me with cost inquires.\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nWooden beads will start to wear down if they get wet. \nSilver and gold pieces can be polished after some time of use. It is normal for metal to wear a bit with time. \n\nAll the bracelets are made with ELASTIC beading string. I aim to always use the highest quality materials and even though the string is made for bracelets, it is possible for accidents to happen and for wear and tear over time.
