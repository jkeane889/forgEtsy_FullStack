            "description": "-3&quot; Round Iron-On Embroidered Patch (but we always recommend sewing it on for longevity.)\n\n\nOur patches iron on best to natural fibers, like cotton or denim, and will not adhere to synthetic fabrics. \n\nHere are a few handy tricks for easy ironing of our patches:\n1. Set your iron to the setting matching the fabric you are adhering to (cotton, linen, etc.)\n2. Lay the garment flat and put a cloth over the area of the item where the patch is to be applied.  Place the heated iron on the cloth and press down firmly for 8 seconds to heat up the garment.\n3. Place your iron-on patch on the pre-heated area, put the cloth on top of the patch and press down firmly for 8-10 seconds with your iron.  Turn garment inside out, put a cloth on top of the patch area, and press down with the iron for another 5 seconds.\n4. Remove the iron and cloth, set the item aside and allow it to fully cool before handling.\n5. Show off your sweet new patch to all your friends!",

The cases we produce offer protection for your phone with access to all ports, buttons and the camera lens. The cases are easily snapped on for a tight fit to help protect the phone.\n\nEach design is printed using a dye ink method onto a aluminium plate which creates a long lasting, washable, durable, vibrant print. Colour accuracy is everything to us and we aim to produce the highest quality print. The aluminium is then attached to the rubber style case in your choice of Black or white. \n\nCamera cutaway position varies between phone models\n\nHow long it takes to receive an order depends where you are located. Orders are processed and shipped within 1-2 days, all orders are shipped from the Uk and transit times are as follows-\n\nUnited Kingdom 1-2 working days \nEurope 5-7 working days\nUSA and rest of the world 7-10 working days.",

We guarantee your satisfaction, and with such an affordable price, there is no need to shop at big retailers or other expensive shops. \n\n\nFOUNDER OF ONESTOPTIESHOP\nI created this shop as a side business. As a Family and Businessman, I understand the importance of a balanced product. We all search for a perfect luxury product that won’t break the bank. I grew weary of overpaying for ties that were just named brand, made with cheap materials. My wife and I struggled to find affordable ties and/or matching pocket squares. I could not believe there weren&#39;t great sets available that caught my eye and didn&#39;t break the bank! I decided to take matters into my own hands and so we created a shop where one can buy sets that matched perfectly and didn&#39;t look outdated or overused. We strive to be unique, affordable and offer a peace of mind like no other to customers. If I could return all the ties and hankies I overpaid for, I would, but there were no other alternatives like this shop at the time. I hope you take advantage of my shop, save yourself money, and look great doing it.",

However, it is our policy that once your digital order has been delivered we cannot send you a different photograph because you like another better.

Please message me and I will do my best.

These brilliant hand airbrushed translucent ombre colors fade from bright candy colors to frosted silver to black. The vibrant colors pop in the sun--absoluetly stunning!\n\nAbout CarLashes®\n\nYou are now entering the formerly forbidden &quot;Man-Zone&quot; of car accessories. Move over mud flaps and racing stripes and say hello to eyelashes for your car! CarLashes® turn the daily drab of driving into a fun and fashionable, feel-good (even emotional) adventure.\n\nSince exploding online in 2010, CarLashes® have gone from a girly trend to a diva necessity. Ladies have traditionally had few options for customizing their vehicles--and after all, ladies have serious purchasing power. Women buy more than half of the new cars in the U.S. and influence up to 85 percent of all car purchases. Sure, women may seek a practical ride that fits their needs and lifestyle, but they also crave a little bling … and a lot of fun.\n\nLovely ladies across the globe have lashed up to join the Miles of Smiles Movement to shatter the myth that car accessories are just for men. The Miles of Smiles Movement is all about feeling great inside and out and spreading some love along the way.",

All  have been freshly washed and ironed.\n\nSizes vary.\n\nAll of the hankies are nicely packaged for protection and care, and come from a smoke free home.  \n\nThank for visiting!\nFalling Coconuts",
